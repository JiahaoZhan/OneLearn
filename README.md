An website designed intending to teach job related, practical programming skills for everyone.

This tiny webpage and sign up page is used to demonstrate my understanding of web design and the use of bootstrap 4.0.

This is fairly a simple demo because I only have beginning knowledge bootstrap.

I will be greatly appricated if you reviewed my pages.
